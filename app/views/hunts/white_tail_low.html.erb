	These are rifle only, unguided hunts that take place from a blind overlooking a feeder, as well as acres of farm country.   A guide will escort you to the hunting location and show you your boundaries.  From there, you are on your own.  You will be able to take up to 1 buck of your choice, along with 3 does and 1 hog.

<p>Thousands of acres of peanuts, corn, milo, wheat, and oats attract large influxes of deer and hogs to our properties, providing hunters with a target rich environment. This makes our Low Fence Farm Hunts an absolute blast.</p>
